# TIC TAC TOE GAME
In this project, it is assigned for us to create a Tic Tac Toe game using only Ruby to increase our knowledge on the OOP concepts. This project was split in 4 milestones, which were:

 - Setting up the project
 - Designing the user interface
 - Creating the game logic
 - Writing the game instructions
 
 The main goal of this project is to asure I master the methods ruby provides and to learn how to replicate them using basic coding knowledge.

# Built With
- Ruby
- Rubocop
- OOP
- Linters

# Prerequisites
- Browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari or any other browser)

# Setup
Open Terminal

Run git clone <a href ="https://github.com/t-yanick/oop/tree/milestone_1">Repository</a>

Run ruby bin/main

# Game Rules
- The Game will launch a Board on the screen
- Each player can only choose one position per turn
- You are not allowed to select a position if another player already have a mark there
- First player is the 'X'
- Second player is the 'O'
- Win when a complete line has the same symbols 'X X X' or 'O O O '
- If nobody wins after all positions have a symbol it will be a draw.

# Game instructions (Screenshots)
